================

The script is set up to run two bidder experimentation (~6.5 hours). Simply run "python utils.py" in the directory and the appropriate files and pdfs will be generated.

pdfs will be created in /data and the csv files generated in ./ contain a summary of the data (opt, ratio, max reserve, datapoints etc...)
